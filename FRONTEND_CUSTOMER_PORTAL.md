# Development Plan: Frontend Customer Portal

## 1. Goal

To create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly customer portal using Next.js. This portal will be the primary interface for clients to manage their shipments, track their packages, and view their account history.

## 2. User Stories

* **As a client, I want to be able to log in to my account securely** so that I can access my personal information and shipment details.
* **As a client, I want to have a clear overview of all my active and past shipments** in a centralized dashboard.
* **As a client, I want to be able to track the real-time status of my shipments** with a clear and intuitive timeline visualization.
* **As a client, I want to be able to view my quote history** so that I can refer back to previous estimates.
* **As a client, I want to be able to download my final invoices** so that I have a record of my expenses.
* **As a client, I want to be able to manage my profile information** so that I can keep my contact and delivery details up-to-date.

## 3. Proposed Solution

I will develop a single-page application (SPA) using Next.js and the App Router. The portal will be fully responsive and will provide a seamless user experience across all devices. I will use NextAuth.js for authentication, and I will integrate with the Django backend to fetch and display all the necessary data. The portal will feature a main dashboard, a detailed shipment tracking page, a quote history page, and a profile management page.
