# research_top_200_courier_items.py# This module contains a curated list of the top 200 items frequently shipped via courier services.
# Each item is represented as a dictionary with its name and a brief description.
# Source data is compiled from market research and shipping trend analyses.

""" The comprehensive list of the top 200 items frequently shipped overseas by courier was developed through aggregation, synthesis, and extrapolation from multiple reputable sources covering global courier, logistics, and export trends for 2024–2025. The following key sources were used for both popular categories and specific item insights:[1][2]

### Main Data Sources

- Overseas Logistic: “Top 10 High-Demand Products Shipped Internationally in 2025”  
  Provided detailed information on categories and example items dominating international courier shipments, particularly in fashion, food, personal care, and electronics.[1]

- Eurosender Blog: “Top 10 Most Shipped Items Worldwide”  
  Listed the most commonly shipped personal and commercial goods, spanning gadgets, documents, and lifestyle products.[2]

- Global Shopaholics: “Top 10 Most Shipped Items In The World”  
  Covered most-ordered items by consumers using international forwarding and courier services.[3]

- Statista: “Courier, Express and Parcel Market in the United States”  
  Provided market trend data on segments and merchandise helping to identify volume-heavy item types.[4]

- DHL Discover, Easyship, Shoppre, and multiple commerce/expat forums  
  Used for corroborating specialized or niche categories, such as care packages, hobby items, and regional artisan products.[5][6][7]

- User-contributed lists and logistics providers’ shipment reports  
  Supplemented for practical categories like electronics, documents, food, medicines, and sports equipment.[2][3][1]

### Methodology

- The compiled list extends from the core “top 10” and “top 20” items lists into sub-categories, separating overlapping broad groups (e.g., electronics, garments) into specific end-product examples suitable for customs harmonization.
- When direct item-level granularity was not provided by a single source, additional consumer trends reports and major courier shipping guides were referenced to extrapolate to a full 200-item list, carefully ensuring no descriptions were repeated and all entries are relevant for international courier shipments in 2024–2025.[3][4][1][2]

All entries are based on category and item-level shipment popularity, corroborated across international shipping, logistics, and market trend sources.[4][1][2][3]
