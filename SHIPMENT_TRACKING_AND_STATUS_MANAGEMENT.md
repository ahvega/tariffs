# Development Plan: Shipment Tracking & Status Management

## 1. Goal

To provide a comprehensive and real-time shipment tracking system for both clients and staff. This system will be the primary interface for monitoring the progress of a shipment from the moment it is requested until it is delivered to the client.

## 2. User Stories

* **As a client, I want to be able to track the status of my shipment in real-time** so that I know where my package is at all times.
* **As a client, I want to see a detailed history of my shipment's journey** so that I can understand the different stages of the shipping process.
* **As a staff member, I want to be able to update the status of a shipment easily** so that I can keep the tracking information accurate and up-to-date.
* **As a staff member, I want to be able to view and manage all shipments in a centralized dashboard** so that I can have a clear overview of the operational workload.
* **As a staff member, I want to receive notifications for important shipment events** so that I can take timely action when required.

## 3. Proposed Solution

I will develop a robust shipment tracking system that leverages the `StatusUpdate` model to provide a detailed, event-sourced history for each shipment. The system will have two main interfaces: a client-facing tracking page and a staff-facing operations dashboard.

The client-facing page will provide a timeline view of the shipment's journey. The staff-facing dashboard will provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing shipments, including status updates, bulk actions, and search and filtering capabilities.
