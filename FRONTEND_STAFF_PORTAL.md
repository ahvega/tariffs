# Development Plan: Frontend Staff Portal

## 1. Goal

To create a powerful and efficient staff portal using Next.js that will serve as the primary tool for managing all operational aspects of the shipping process. This portal will empower staff to manage shipments, update statuses, and handle the liquidation and invoicing process.

## 2. User Stories

* **As a staff member, I want to be able to log in to the portal securely** so that I can access the operational dashboard.
* **As a staff member, I want a centralized dashboard to view and manage all shipments** with powerful filtering and sorting capabilities.
* **As a staff member, I want to be able to update the status of a shipment quickly and easily** so that the tracking information is always accurate.
* **As a staff member, I want an interface to review and approve the final costs of a shipment** before an invoice is generated.
* **As a staff member, I want to be able to generate a PDF invoice for a shipment** and mark it as paid.
* **As a staff member, I want to be able to manage client accounts** so that I can provide customer support.

## 3. Proposed Solution

I will develop a dedicated Next.js application for the staff portal. This application will provide a comprehensive set of tools for managing the entire shipping workflow. The portal will feature a secure login for staff members, a powerful shipment management dashboard, a detailed shipment view with status update capabilities, and a dedicated interface for the liquidation and invoicing process. The portal will be designed to be efficient and intuitive, enabling staff to perform their daily tasks with ease.
